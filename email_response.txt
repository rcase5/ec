Dear Customer,

It appears you have 10005 errors in your log file. If you run the following
command on your log, you should be able to get a handle on where the errors are:

grep -c "error" logs.txt

That command will give you the error count. Removing the "-c" should give you
a list of the actual errors.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Regards,

Robert Case...
